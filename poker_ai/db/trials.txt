Trial ID 1: control generation = 0 (random), initial generation = 1 (random) ran to generation 111 (111 generations)
	-- steady improvement
	
Trial ID 2: control generation = 103 (best of trial 1), initial generation = 112 (max gen from trial 1 + 1), ran to generation 181 (70 generations)
	-- did not settle into an improvement
	
Trial ID 3: control generation = 103 (best of trial 1), initial generation = 182 (max gen from trial 1 + 1) set from random, ran to generation z (h generations)




---------------------------- new set
Trial ID 1: control generation = 0 (random), initial generation = 1 (random) ran to generation 217 (217 generations)
	-- steady improvement, shallow increase trend
	-- started gen 217 with mutation rate increased from .001 to .05
	-- ran to gen 280 marked decline, suspect mutation rate too high

Trial ID 2: copied trial 1 generation 217 to trial 2 generation 0; initial generation 1 from random.  95 generations
	-- rapid initial improvement, settled around gen 4.  Shallow decline in linear trend.

Trial ID 3: control generation = 0 (random), initial generation = 1 (random), now including 5x2 = 10 carry over strategies
	similar to trial 1, no real difference
